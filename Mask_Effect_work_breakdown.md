# Mask Effect Game Jam (48 Hours)

## Project Kick-off & Initial Design

### Team Alignment & Concept Finalization

- Confirm "Mask Effect" Core Loop & MVP Features
  
  - [ ] Define the primary gameplay loop focusing on how players interact with masks and mech combat to ensure engaging and repeatable mechanics.

    - [x] Detail the sequence of player actions within the gameplay loop, such as selecting masks, deploying mechs, engaging in combat, and utilizing mask abilities at strategic moments to influence battle outcomes.

    - [ ] Describe how mask effects dynamically alter mech capabilities or battlefield conditions, ensuring that each mask introduces unique tactical options that encourage diverse playstyles.

    - [ ] Explain the interaction timing and resource management aspects, for example, cooldowns or energy costs associated with applying mask effects to maintain balanced and thoughtful gameplay.

    - [ ] Illustrate how feedback mechanisms (visual, audio, and UI cues) communicate the impact of mask effects during combat to keep players informed and engaged with the evolving battle state.

    - [ ] Include a brief consideration of how player decisions within this loop feed into larger progression systems or unlockables, reinforcing motivation to experiment with different masks and combat strategies.

  - [x] Identify the minimum viable product (MVP) features that deliver the core experience within the 48-hour timeframe, prioritizing essential mask effects and mech interactions.

      > Local test mode with random AI opponent  
      > Auto matchmaking vs. online opponent  
      > 1 Level
      > 3 Mechs  
      > 3 Masks  
      > Final score display  
      > 
  - [x] Establish clear win and loss conditions that tie directly into the mask effect mechanics to create meaningful gameplay stakes.

  - [x] Outline player progression elements related to masks, such as unlocking new masks or upgrading existing ones, to include in the MVP scope.

  - [x] Set measurable goals for player feedback during the jam, such as clarity of mask effects and combat mechanics, to validate the core loop’s appeal.

- Define 24-Hour Playable Demo Scope
  
### Technical Setup

- [x] Create Unity Project & Version Control (Git)
  
  - Set up the Unity project with an appropriate project structure, including folders for scripts, assets, scenes, and prefabs to maintain organized development workflow.

  - Initialize Git version control repository and configure .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files such as local Unity cache and build folders for efficient repository management.

- [ ] Integrate Basic Unity Packages (e.g., TextMeshPro)
  
- [x] Set Up AI Tool Access (Claude Code/Sixth AI)
