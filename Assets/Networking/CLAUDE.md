# Networking Component Sub-tasks (Stretch Goals)

## Overview

This document outlines networking-related tasks for the 'Mask Effect' project. Based on project consensus, online multiplayer networking is considered a **stretch goal** and is not part of the MVP for the 48-hour game jam. These tasks should only be pursued if the core local AI auto-battler is fully functional and polished.
